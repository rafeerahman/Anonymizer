# 01/27 Meeting Minutes
- usability is our top priority with this project. that means we need to make smart design choices and focus on great documentation.
- we can be given keywords to remove from the data which makes the processing a lot easier.
- inputs will be structured text; i.e. peer reviews, evals, testimonials, and spreadsheets (csv's).
- david is best reached on slack. I think we should keep our primary communication on discord and one or two of us could be in charge of asking him our questions.

- python/flask is a strong first choice of tech for this project because the product needs to be lightweight and functional
- code can be MIT or maybe GPL
- we will mostly be generating our own sample data
- hosting must be a free service
- if we have time, we can make a simple frontend
- an extra feature could be warnings if additional, unspecified sensitive data is in the text beyond the specified keywords
