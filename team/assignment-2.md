# 1. Summary of software

### a. paragraph for problem & partner

The product is a robust and straightforward rest API that allows university faculty to efficiently anonymize sensitive data, e.g. student peer reviews. The problem that many faculty members face is the handling of this data: often, it needs to be processed in large quantities and stored anonymously. Manually anonymizing this data is not only needlessly laborious, but it is also a privacy concern, because students expect that their answers are kept confidential.

Our product will facilitate the anonymization of this data by way of a rest API. This will provide a flexible interface for faculty to use our product, regardless of what technology they are using. Our product will be able to anonymize a list of text fields, given the sensitive data (names), and the terms to replace them with. Our product will also have the capability to anonymize spreadsheets via csv upload, with a target column and the value to replace the sensitive data with.

### b. paragraph existing any existing software/infrastructure (if applicable)

There are some libraries out there that people may use to anonymize their data such as pynonymizer and Faker. The pynonimizer library only supports one type of anonymization method, which is pseudonymization, by using the Faker library to generate random pseudonyms for attributes like e-mails, names, and more. Institutions  may want different anonymization methods, and they may not want to rely on these libraries because of the strict GDPR regulations they have to follow, and they also may not trust the third-party software.

By providing flexible anonymization methods, we will support our project partnerâ€™s goal of creating an automated and seamless process of anonymizing data following GDPR guidelines for organizational needs.

# 3. Paragraph for each sub-team

### Frontend
Given our front end user story, we started by creating an initial design in figma to map out how the website would look, how many pages were needed, and how our website would be navigated. We decided the majority of the front end user story would be served by our playground page. After creating our figma design our team created the website, the playground page, and the navigation in REACT. The playground page has a drop down menu where the user can select either the csv endpoint or text file endpoint and upload the appropriate file to be anonymized accordingly. Additionally, there is a text input box where the user can input text that will be anonymized. There is also a parameter input section where the user can upload key value pairs for which words that will be replaced. FInally, both React states and toast alerts have been set up to handle data and errors once our front end is connected to the back end. 


### Backend

For this assignment, the backend team created the foundation for the project backend, which includes the file structure, testing procedure, and the coding environment. We aimed to create
a modular file structure to be flexible to the addition of more Resources or external libraries.
There is one functional endpoint which takes in the string that is being anonymized along with a dictionary of key values, and returns an anonymized text. 
The backend testing was done through Postman, where every edge case was covered. The JSON file of the postman collection is also included in addition to all the backend code for future changes.
